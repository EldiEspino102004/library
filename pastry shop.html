                <h2>Ancient and Medieval Beginnings</h2>
                <p><strong>Ancient Egypt and Rome:</strong> The origins of pastries can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Egyptians and Romans used honey and nuts to create early sweet treats. However, these were more like simple cakes or bread rather than what we consider pastries today.</p>
                <p><strong>Medieval Europe:</strong> During the Middle Ages, the art of pastry making advanced significantly in Europe. The use of refined sugar and spices like cinnamon and cloves became popular. Pastries were often enjoyed during feasts and were considered a luxury due to the cost of ingredients.</p>

                <p><strong>16th to 18th Centuries:</strong> The Renaissance period saw a rise in culinary sophistication in Europe, particularly in France. This era introduced the use of butter in pastry making, which greatly improved the flavor and texture of pastries. French bakers began to perfect techniques for making puff pastry and other delicate treats.</p>
                <p><strong>Early Modern Europe:</strong> By the 17th and 18th centuries, pastries were becoming more accessible to the general public. The development of baking techniques and the availability of ingredients like butter and refined flour contributed to the growth of pastry shops.</p>
